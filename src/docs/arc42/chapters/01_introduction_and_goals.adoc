== Introduction and Goals

Good diagrams are very important for a good documentation.
https://www.zenuml.com/[ZenUML] is open source, online, desktop and platform integrated diagramming software which does an amazing job.

One of the main features is that it is able to store the sources of the diagram as plain text.
That makes it ideal for documenting software.

=== Task Definition

The goal is to create a plugin for IntelliJ based IDEs which

* adds a recognizable icon to all ZenUML files,
* opens ZenUML files with ZenUML viewer

Additional tasks might be added in the future.
